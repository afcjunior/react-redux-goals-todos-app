https://react-redux-goals-todos-v1.firebaseapp.com/

React/Redux app that allows you to add and remove items from two separate lists (goals and to-dos) and cross out items from one of the lists.

These items are optimistically added to the view and then persisted through a (fake) database (that sometimes error out on purpose).

If something goes wrong with the action attempted, the process is undone and the user is alerted.


The only purpose of this was to learn redux (and using it with react), so I completely ignored the CSS. Will add it later on.
